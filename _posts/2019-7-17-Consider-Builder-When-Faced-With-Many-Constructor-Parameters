The common way when you faced with common constuctor params is to define multi constructors or setter and getters methods (JavaBeans).

While there a better way, we will descuss disadvantage of using these common way first.

#### Disadvantage of Multi Constructors:
 Constructor pattern works, but it's hard to write client code when there are many parameters,
 and harder still to read it.

#### Disadvantage of JavaBean:
 - Because construction is split across multiple calls, **A JavaBean may be in and inconsistent state partway through its construction.
 
 - Precludes the possibility of making class immutable
 
#### Advantage of Builder Pattern:
 - Easy to write and more importantly, easy to read.
 - It's simulates named optional parameters as found in Python and Scala.
 - Well suited to class hierarchies



   **Builder pattern is good choice when designing classes whose constructors or static factories would have more
   than a handful of parameters**
